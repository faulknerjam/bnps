## Coal Mining Example
Here we provide the code to reproduce the results from the example on coal mine disasters given in Faulkner and Minin (2015).  


### Data

The data are number of disasters per year for the years 1851-1962.  The following code sets up a vector of the annual event counts and then creates a list with the data components needed for the models to run.

```{r eval=FALSE}
ncount <- c(4,5,4,1,0,4,3,4,0,6,3,3,4,0,2,6,3,3,5,4,5,3,1,4,4,1,5,5,3,4,2,5,2,2,3,4,2,1,3,2,2,1,1,1,1,3,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,3,1,0,3,2,2,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,2,3,3,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,2,3,3,0,0,0,1,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1)

coal_dat <- list(J = length(ncount), y = ncount)

```

### Run Models

In the paper we compare three different configurations for the prior distributions on the order-*k* differences in latent function values (normal, Laplace, and horseshoe).
